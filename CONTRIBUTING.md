We take our open source community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/iampranabroy/osse-calculator/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing PRs before creating your own.
- If you've never contributed before, see [the first timer's guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) from opensource.guide for resources and tips on how to get started.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Push changes to your fork
6. Open a PR in our repository and so that we can review the changes.
